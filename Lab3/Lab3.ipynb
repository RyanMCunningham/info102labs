    "## Strings \n",
    "As we discussed in class, strings are the way we encode text in computers. Let’s start by exploring how Python represents strings. Below, you'll find a program. This program starts by creating two lists. Lists in Python start with the \\[ symbol and end with the \\] symbol. Each of the elements of the list is separated by a comma. The first list created by this script contains a series of integers and the second contains a list of strings. Both lists happen to be of length 8. After creating the two lists, the program loops through each of the elements of the two lists. And does... something to them. You should try to figure out what this loop is doing. The nice part about Python is that you can add print statements to view almost any value. Try printing out the value of i or n1 or n2 or any of the other values in the loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "You’ll find two Python programs in the cells below for this portion of the lab. You’ll have to run both. The first program imports a collection of sorting algorithms from a file called \"sorts.py\". It then builds a list of random strings. It then sorts the lists using each one of the algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort, merge sort, and quick sort. These are all famous algorithms for sorting lists. We also sort the list using Python's built-in sorting algorithm. This program times how long each of the algorithms take to sort the list. As you change n (the size of the list) you'll see that the amount of time taken changes dramatically. Try changing n a few times to see how the numbers change for the different sorting algorithms. **WARNING:** Don't go too crazy here. A lot of people are sharing these computers. Keep n below 3000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you run the sorting program, the timing results are added to a file. The second program draws a graph of n (the size of the list) vs. t (the amount of time required to sort the list) for each of the sorting algorithms. You’ll want to collect enough data to understand the impact these values have on the runtime, so try running the sort programs with at least 10 different values for n."
