    "This week, we will be looking at 2 machine learning datasets. The first, `wines.txt`, is a database containing a chemical analysis of three different wine cultivars. There are 178 wines with 13 features in this data set. The task in this dataset is to predict which cultivar each wine belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second dataset, `mystery.txt`, is a mystery. There are 10 features for each data point, and we are trying to predict a numerical result `R`. There are over 25,000 data points in this data set. This is a very simple task, which could be performed perfectly by about 15 lines of Python code. Youâ€™ll find that our machine learning classifiers have a very hard time with it. Play with the different classifiers and see if you can get one to do reasonably well."
